My first day at MYOB (excluding orientation week) I tasked myself with the challenge of building a Jekyll blog without forking it from somewhere else.

The challenges I faced where:
* Setting up ZSH (preferred shell in Iterm2) I like to set it up in this style [iterm-shell]
* Installing macports - needed to download xcode
* Downloading xcode over Myob Wifi - had to jack into a ethernet at someone else's desk
* Realizing that MacPorts wasn't going to be needed
* Setting up ssh keys for github as it looks like you can't use a password from command line with 2FA (this wasn't too difficult) - [github-ssh]
* Setting up Jekyll locally [jekyll-docs]
* Changing the theme of Jekjyll to one that github supports [github-themes]
 

My next challenge will be setting up vscode and netcore for osx to begin the myob coding challenege
