My first day at MYOB (excluding orientation week) I tasked myself with the challenge of building a Jekyll blog without forking it from somewhere else.

The challenges I faced were:
* Setting up ZSH (preferred shell in Iterm2) I like to set it up in this style [iterm-shell]
* Installing MacPorts to work with ZSH - needed to download XCode [macports]
* Downloading Xcode over Myob wifi - had to jack into a Ethernet at someone else's desk
* Realizing that MacPorts wasn't going to be needed
* Setting up SSH keys for GitHub as it looks like you can't use a password from command line with 2FA (this wasn't too difficult) - [github-ssh]
* Setting up Jekyll locally [jekyll-docs]
* Changing the theme of Jekyll to one that Github supports [github-themes]
 

My next challenge will be setting up vs code and net core for OSX to begin the myob coding challenge
