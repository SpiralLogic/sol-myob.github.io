# Introduction
I found the Apprenticeship patterns book a fascinating read. Many of the topics in the book have resonated with my life journey and experiences. This blog post is less a review on this book and more notes on my how I have found each chapter speaks to me in my past, present and future.

Initially this will be a summary of my notes from the book and will over time develop.

## Preface

**Pattern** "A pattern is a named description of a recurring solution to a problem in a given context. The description should give readers a deep enough understanding of the problem to either apply the stated solution to their own context or decide that a particular pattern is not appropriate to their situation."

Apprenticeship -> Journeyman -> Master

## Emptying the Cup

### Your first language
* I have found fiddlers, such as [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CSharp](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) as useful tools for quick feedback loops when using both compiled and interpreted languages. They allow you to test the execution of code quickly and examine the results.
* Eventually you can go from writing learning tests (those that help you learn a language) to tests that check your actual code.
* Test's are just as important to validate code now as they are for validating in the future (i.e. upgrading versions)
* "It is possible to learn a language on your own, but it takes a long time to learn the spirit of a language unless you interact with experts" - Ralph Johnson
* **Subtleties** other languages always exist. often these are in books that start with *effective*. _Read these books after mastering simple syntax_:
    * [Muenchian method (XSLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT/Muenchian_grouping)
    * [Schwartzian Transform (Perl)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform)
    * [Duff's Device (C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device)

### The White Belt
* **Neotany** Childlike quality is found in people who have unusually high degree of potential (i.e. Mozart, Einstein)
* Sacrifice productivity in order to improve your skills. This can be achieved by learning a second language

### Unleash your Enthusiasm
* I would like to think that I love to do this everyday most days already

### Concrete Skills
* Acquire and maintain concrete skills. This will help you move into teams of craftsmen that will provide you better learning opportunities than you already have.
* Hiring managers take a leap of faith in choosing you
* _Collect CV's of people whose skills you respect_
