# Introduction
I found the Apprenticeship patterns book a fascinating read. Many of the topics in the book have resonated with my life journey and experiences. This blog post is less a review on this book and more notes on my how I have found each chapter speaks to me in my past, present and future.

Initially this will be a summary of my notes from the book and will over time develop.

## Preface

**Pattern** "A pattern is a named description of a recurring solution to a problem in a given context. The description should give readers a deep enough understanding of the problem to either apply the stated solution to their own context or decide that a particular pattern is not appropriate to their situation."

Apprenticeship -> Journeyman -> Master

## Emptying the Cup

### Your first language
* I have found fiddlers, such as [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CSharp](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) as useful tools for quick feedback loops when using both compiled and interpreted languages. They allow you to test the execution of code quickly and examine the results.
* Eventually you can go from writing learning tests (those that help you learn a language) to tests that check your actual code.
* Test's are just as important to validate code now as they are for validating in the future (i.e. upgrading versions)
* "It is possible to learn a language on your own, but it takes a long time to learn the spirit of a language unless you interact with experts" - Ralph Johnson
* **Subtleties** other languages always exist. often these are in books that start with *effective*. __Read these books after mastering simple syntax__:
    * [Muenchian method (XSLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT/Muenchian_grouping)
    * [Schwartzian Transform (Perl)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform)
    * [Duff's Device (C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device)

### The White Belt
* **Neotany** Childlike quality is found in people who have unusually high degree of potential (i.e. Mozart, Einstein)
* Sacrifice productivity in order to improve your skills. This can be achieved by learning a second language

### Unleash your Enthusiasm
* I would like to think that I love to do this everyday most days already

### Concrete Skills
* Acquire and maintain concrete skills. This will help you move into teams of craftsmen that will provide you better learning opportunities than you already have.
* Hiring managers take a leap of faith in choosing you
* __Collect CV's of people whose skills you respect__
> Like most people who come to programming "later" in life, I brought a bunch of life experience with me, far more than your average programmer with six months of experience. I had developed all sorts of interpersonal skills and psychological insights in my previous career. As I progressed as a programmer, I would meet people who would get very excited about my past and this led me to occasionally overvalue these softer skills, or overpursue nontechnical topics. To be sure, my soft skill have served me well and have helped me tremendously in many situations; however. I have had to let these skills atrophy a bit in order to focus the majority of my attention on developing my technical skills, which was obviously the are where I was most lacking. I didn't switch careers so I could be a therapist to programmers; I switched careers because I love the act of crafting software. - Dave Hoover
* **Collect CVs of people who's skills you respect** (linked in too)

### Expose your ignorance
* Conceding to unspoken pressures and telling people what they want to hear is not a good way to build strong relationships. Tell people the truth. Let them know that you're starting to understand what they want and you're in the process of learning how to give it to them.
* Get used to this learning process. This is craftsmanship

## Walking the Long Road
### The Long Road
Close your eyes and imagine the strangest possible role you could be playing in 10 years' time. Have fun thinking of the wackiest possible future for yourself. Then think about 20, 30 and 40 years from now. What kinds of experiences do you want to have tried? Imagine that 40 years from now you are asked to write a short-description of your professional history and the biggest influences on your path. Use the output from that thought experiment to help you plan your future career choices. 

### Sustainable Motivations - Ensure that your motivations for craftsmanship will adapt and survive through the trials and tribulations of The Load Road
> ... There is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind of software that's interesting to write... If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free. - Paul Graham, Hackers & Painters

* **Golden Lock**: "I'd like to learn something new, but what I already know pays too well" - Don't fall into this trap - __I avoided this when moving from QSR to MYOB__
* On a couple of occasions, Marten Gustafson has found himself in the midst of a project death march because his passion for the craft induced him to throw all of his time and energy into the project. Marten is no the first nor the last young programmer to throw himself into the bottomless pit with the good intention of heroically saving the day. If you are walking The Long Road to mastery, it is essential that you Nurture Your Passion for software craftsmanship while keeping it in the balance with the other aspects of your life. Naturally, there will be times where the scales will tip in one direction or the another. Nevertheless, you should be conscious of the balancing act all along The Long Road.

### Nurture Your Passion
* Study the classics. Immersing yourself in some of the great literature of our field can carry you through the rough spots when your passion is in jeopardy. These timeless books can open your eyes to a different world, a world where things can be better.
* **On your way to work prepare a list of three positive ideas to talk about. During the day, if the conversation starts to sap your energy, steer it to one of these three topics. The aim is to take control and avoid being dragged down by the negative conversations around you. On the way home, review your level of success and think about other ways to improve your environment.**

### Draw your own map - Identify a logical but ambitious next step for your career. Understand it's not up to your employer
* Rather than simply writing down high-level goals, try to define small, achievable steps. These small steps will provide feedback that you can use to modify your map, but they also make it easier to get help from Kindred Spirits to achieve your goals. After all, there's not much anybody else can do to help you become what Paul Graham calls "a great hacker" but they can point you toward the resources that will help you learn Lisp or Unix socket programming or achieve similarly well-define goals.
* If you need to move into a less hierarchically impressive role in order to stay "on the map", consider The Long Road and compare the relative importance of impressive (short-term) titles and salaries to working in a company that is more congruent with your goals and will lead you to greater heights in the long term.
 > Take a chance on me - Pedro
 * Too many organizations pigeonhole people and take a short-sighted approach to their personnel
 
### Use Your Title - Do not allow your title to affect you, it is a distraction
 * Don't be fooled by an impressive title
 * *Write down a long and descriptive version of your job title. Make sure it accurately reflects what you really do at work and your skill level. Keep this updated, and from time to time imagine how you would view a stranger who had this job description.*
 
### Stay in the Trenches - The offer of a promotion will test whether you have Sustainable Motivations and are willing to walk the Long Road
 * Every day that you are not programming is a step away from becoming a journeyman

## Accurate Self-Assessment
You must fight this tendency toward mediocrity by seeking out and learning about other teams, organizations, journeymen and master craftsmen

### **Be The Worst**!
* Surround yourself with developers who are better than you. Find a stronger team where you are the weakest member and have room to grow.
* [Resignation and Postmortem] (https://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html)
> Joining Obtiva put me back at the bottom of the food chain. Now, I'm a green Software Appentice and it'll be awhile before I head a team of developers. Instead of leading I'll be learning. I've been demoted.
> Why would someone choose that? 
> First, being the worst on a team of outstanding developers can't be compensated for with environment, equipment, or money. You can't compensate for learning next to people who have already traveled the path and know how to avoid the holes on the road ahead. Pairing with great software developers is invaluable. If you're new to programming and have not had the opportunity to pair then you need to demand the experience. - [Brian Tatnall](https://syntatic.wordpress.com/2007/05/18/new-beginnings-with-obtiva/)

### Find Mentors - Seek out those who have gone ahead of you and strive to learn from them.
* Our field is very young and therefore has few recognized masters.

### Kindred Spirits - To keep momentum going, you need to be in frequent contact with people who are walking a similar road
* Organizational cultures that encourage software craftsmanship are rare. You find yourself stranded without mentors and in an atmosphere that seems at odds with your aspirations.

### Rubbing elbows
* Find ways to sit with another software developer and accomplish a hands-on task together, side-by-side. There are some things that can only be learning while you are sitting with another software developer to accomplish a shared objective.
* Pair programming
* Ping-Pong Programming

### Sweep the floor
* Volunteer for simple, unglamourous, yet necessary tasks
* Examples of these tasks include:
  - maintaining the build system 
  - production support 
  - responding to maintenance requests
  - bug fixing 
  - code review
  - eliminating technical debt
  - setting up the project wiki
  - updating documentation
  - acting as a sounding board from other people's ideas
 * Focus on the edges of the system where there is less risk
 
 ## Perpetual Learning
 ### Expand Your Bandwidth
 * drink from the fire hose of information
 
 ### Practice, Practice, Practice
 * A Kata is a choreographed sequence of movements provided by a master to help his students internalize the fundamentals of the art.
 
 ### Breakable Toys
 * I have been creating a word cloud in c#/WPF this is what I would consider my breakable toy [Word Cloud](https://github.com/SpiralLogic/WordCloud)
 * Budget for failure by designing and building toy systems that are similar in toolset, but not scope to the systems you build at work
 * The Breakable Toys pattern is similar to Be the Worse, bu that pattern is about finding a team where you can grow. Breakable Toys is more about deliberately creating opportunities to learn by stepping beyond your boundaries and single-handedly building complete software projects. It is also related to The White Belt and Confront Your Ignorance, but is less focused on letting go of your previous knowledge
 
 ### Use The Source - Seek out other people's source code
 Here are a few links I have found containing good open source projects:
 
[What source code is worth studying](https://medium.com/@012parth/what-source-code-is-worth-studying-8755f88f8de5)
[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aawesome&type=Repositories)

* People who can quickly absorb knowledge directly from the code soon become much better programmers, because their teacher is every line of code written by every programmer every born

### Record What You Learn
* Keep a record of your journey

### Share What You Learn
* Being part of a community of individuals where both learning on your own and humbly sharing that newly acquired knowledge are valued as one of the most powerful aspects of apprenticeship, It makes otherwise-esoteric fields of knowledge suddenly accessible, and provides apprentices with guides who speak their language.
* When one person teaches, two people learn

### Create Feedback Loops
* Create mechanisms for regularly gathering more or less objective external data about your performance. By soliciting feedback early, often, and effectively, you increase the probability that you will at least be conscious of your incompetence.


### Summing up
* Software is not a product, it's a medium for storing knowledge. Therefore, software development is not a product producing activity, it is a knowledge acquiring activity. Knowledge is just the other side of the coin of ignorance, therefore software development is an ignorance-reduction activity.

## [Construct Your Curriculum](https://sjennings-myob.github.io/reading-list/)
* Maintain a Reading List to track the books you plan to read and remember the books you've read.

### Read Constantly
* Dave spent 90 mins a day on the train to read whatever he wanted (**I am currently taking the long train so I can do the same**). He was so intent that he would continue reading when he got off the train and walked the mile to his cubicle.
* Reading occasional research paper will stretch your mind and keep you in touch with the cutting edge of computer science, and also offers a source of challenging new ideas. Trying to implement these ideas will expand your toolbox with new algorithms, data structures, and design patterns many years before they reach the mainstream.

### Dig Deeper
* Debugging, decompiling and reverse-engineering, and read the specification, RFC, or standards for the technologies you use.
* Examples of this for me have been
    * Using .DotTrace to dig into third part library code
    * Digging into the .Net Framework source code to understand how it (and especially WPF are implemented)
    * Not taking StackOverflow answers at face value and finding evidence for this within the source code
    * Reading WC3 specifications on upcoming HTML/CSS features
    * Reading ECMA standards for C# and ECMAScript
    * Reading RFCs for PHP and C#
* With all this focus on understanding technologies and tools in depth, you need to take care not to accidentally become a narrow specialist.
* Instead continue to seek out opportunities to Be The Worst. Challenge yourself to assemble useful tools from these fundamental building blocks, rather than just basking in your ability to take things apart.

### Familiar Tools
* Identify and focus on a familiar set of tools (**JetBrains**). Ideally, these are the tools where you no longer need the documentation - you either know all the best practices, gotchas and FAQs by heart. Or you have recorded them.
* In time all your favorite tools will become junk

## Conclusion
* Masters should be pestered to explain themselves, to dredge out the assemblage of clues and moves they have in silence within
* Skill matters so much because we don't understand what we do well enough to write it down in a format where anyone can apply it and achieve the same results
* [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
* When we say something is a craft, one of the things we mean is that it is a discipline and a tradition that places a high value on skill. THis includes acquiring, growing and eventually transmitting skill. We believe true mastery is shown in the effect you have on others by transmitting your superior skill.
* Mere genius is not mastery, but if a person is able to train others to equal or surpass his genius, then it becomes evident that person is a potential master (**This is along the lines of what I always used to tell my staff whilst a manager at Safeway**)
* On a scale of 1 to 10 we'd rate ourselves as 9s but sometimes we meet people who make us realize that the scale goes all the way up to 100. There are many practitioners that we deeply respect, but the craft of software development is still lacking masters.
