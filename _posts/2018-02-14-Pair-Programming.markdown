Today consisted of a workshop which allowed us to learn the methodology of and experience pair programming, specifically when doing TDD.

We experienced pair programming in 2 different styles.

1. <strong>Ping Pong</strong> this one of the pair writing the failing test and then the other writing the working implementation. Once this process was complete for one test then the roles were swapped
2. <strong>Driver/Navigator</strong> one of the pair would drive (code, navigate IDE etc) while the other controlled the direction (what test to write, input into implementation)

It was recommended if we get a chance that we should read [TDD] by Kent Beck
